# Golang Wrapper for the Osu! v2 API

Currently, in somewhat active development (Endpoints are added as I need them) and the api is not stable.

If you actually need a stable api wrapper, here are your options:

- https://github.com/accrazed/gosu At the time of writing, no maintenance for 3 years
- https://github.com/diamondburned/gosu-v2 At the time of writing, no maintenance for 5 years
- https://github.com/thehowl/go-osuapi v1 wrapper, might just be enough

If you're interested in getting this API to a stable state, star the repo, contribute, message me etc. If I see that someone actually needs this I'll work on it more actively.
